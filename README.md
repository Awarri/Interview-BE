THERE IS A QA AND MAIN BRANCH, BOTH BRANCHES HAVE THEIR PIPELINES, SO WHEN YOU MAKE CHANGES AND PUSH TO QA, YOU CAN ACCESS IT VIA THE LINK BELOW, THE SAME FOR THE MAIN BRANCH.
THE MAIN BRANCH IS THE PRODUCTION BRANCH THAT WOULD BE SHARED PUBLICLY, SO UNCERTAIN CHANGES SHOULD GO TO QA FIRST.
TO TEST THESE UNCERTAIN CHANGES, USE THE URL.
THERE SHOULD BE NO CONFUSION ON NOT SEEING YOUR UPDATES AFTER DEPLOYMENT IF YOU PUSHED TO A DIFFERENT BRANCH.
